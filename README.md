# Looks

Have you ever seen a character you like so much you thought like:
>Damn wish I knew what sliders he/she used when creating that.

or:
>What the hell is he/she wearing?

or better yet:
>I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT SLIDERS I USED FOR THIS AWESOME CHARACTER I MADE!!11!! PLS HALP

Now you can know.

## Commands:

Command | Usage | Description
---|---|---
!looks | !looks \<command\> \<name or "self"\> | Main Command and arguments.
!looks save | !looks save/grab/json \<name or "self"\> | Generates a JSON file of character sliders.
!looks copy | !looks copy \<name or "self"\> | Copies character data for next character generated.

## Notes:
* !looks save/copy self can always be used.
* !looks save/copy \<name\> requires the character to be nearby (enough to be rendered.)
* !looks copy requires C_CREATE_USER to be mapped (which currently is not.) So the functionality won't work until you map it manually or devs decide to add it to mapped list.
