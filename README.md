Have you ever seen a character you like so much you thought like:
>Damn wish I knew what sliders he/she used when creating that.

or:
>What the hell is he/she wearing?

or better yet:
>I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT SLIDERS I USED FOR THIS AWESOME CHARACTER I MADE!!11!! PLS HALP

Now you can know.

## Commands:

Command | Usage | Description
---|---|---
!looks | !looks \<name\> or "self" | Generates a JSON file in the /data directory containing slider information of the character.

## Notes:
* !looks self can always be used.
* !looks \<name\> requires the character to be nearby (enough to be rendered.)
